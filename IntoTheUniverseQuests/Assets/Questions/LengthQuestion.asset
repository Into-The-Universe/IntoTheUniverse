  CorrectAnswerDescription: 'It has been over ten years in the making but it is expected
    to be in operation just six years. However, the Hubble Telescope was only anticipated
    to be operational for 15 years. But it actually lasted twice as long as that!
    It celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2020.

    

    Using the JWST''s amazing
    technology, scientists will study six of the most distant and luminous quasars
    in the universe. A quasar is a very bright, distant and active supermassive black
    hole. '
