  CorrectAnswerIndex: 1
  CorrectAnswerDescription: "It will be able to see a whopping 13 billion light years
    away from us here on Earth - that's 100 times more powerful than the Hubble Telescope,
    pictured above. \r\n\nJWST's mission is to capture images of the very first stars
    to shine in the Universe. The telescope will also have the power to analyse the
    atmospheres of many of the new planets now being discovered beyond our Solar
    System, and to examine their gases for the possible presence of life. "
