  Question: 'The James Webb Telescope''s mirror is made from Beryllium - a light
    and strong metallic element.


    But what is it coated in to make it more reflective?'
  Answers:
  - Glass
  - Platinum
  - Gold
  CorrectAnswerIndex: 2
  CorrectAnswerDescription: "It's coated in a microscopically thin layer of gold.
    Each of the 18 hexagonal-shaped mirror segments have had to be made to be very
    lightweight - they weight around 20 kilograms each. \r\n\r\nThey also need to
    be kept at very cold temperatures. This is so they can easily identify infrared
    light that distant galaxies in space give off. "
