  Question: How big is the James Webb Telescope's main mirror when fully expanded?
  Answers:
  - 6.5 metres wide
  - 2.5 metres wide
  - 10.5 metres wide
  CorrectAnswerIndex: 0
  CorrectAnswerDescription: 'It''s 6.5 metres wide. It is almost three times larger
    than the primary mirror on the Hubble telescope - so is much more powerful.


    A
    mirror this large has never before been launched into space!


    The mirror
    is so big, it requires a huge sunshade the size of a tennis court to sit underneath
    it so the sun does not interfere with the telescope''s readings. '
