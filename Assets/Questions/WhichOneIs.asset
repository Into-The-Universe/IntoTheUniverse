  question: Which of these images was taken by the James Webb Telescope?
  correctAnswerText: Correct! This is an image of the Carina Nebula. JWST has a mirror
    three times larger than hubble. This larger light collecting area means that
    Webb can peer farther back into time.
  incorrectAnswerText: 'Incorrect! This image was taken by hubble. It was released
    as part of Hubbles 17th anniversary. '
